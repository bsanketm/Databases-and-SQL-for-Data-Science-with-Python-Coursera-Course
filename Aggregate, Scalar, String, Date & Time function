#####Aggregate Functions
Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
SOLN:
SELECT SUM(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;

Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
Soln:
SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST FROM PETRESCUE ;

Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
Soln:
SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;

Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
Soln:
SELECT AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
Soln:
SELECT AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';

###Scalar and String Functions
Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
Soln:
SELECT ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
Soln:
SELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
Soln:
SELECT UCASE(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
Soln:
SELECT DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) FROM PETRESCUE;

Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
Select * from PETRESCUE WHERE LCASE(ANIMAL)= ‘Cat';

#####Date and Time Functions
Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
Soln:
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = ‘Cat’;

Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
Soln:
SELECT SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)=’05';

Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
Soln:
SELECT SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)=’14';

Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
Soln:
Select DAY(RESCUEDATE + 3) from PETRESCUE;
Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between today’s date and the rescue date.
Soln:
select (CURRENT DATE - RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;
SELECT NOW() - (RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;
