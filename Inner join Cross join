Working with Multiple Tables
CROSS JOIN 
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1, table2;

INNER JOIN 
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1, table2
	WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

Accessing Multiple Tables with Sub-Queries
1.Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that   correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
Soln:
select * from employees where JOB_ID IN (select JOB_IDENT from jobs);

2.Retrieve only the list of employees whose JOB_TITLE is Jr. Designer.
Soln:
select * from employees where JOB_ID IN (select JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_TITLE= 'Jr. Designerâ€™);


3.Retrieve JOB information and list of employees who earn more than $70,000.
Soln : 
select JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY,MAX_SALARY,JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_IDENT IN (select JOB_ID from employees where SALARY > 70000 );

4. Retrieve JOB information and list of employees whose birth year is after 1976.
Soln:
select JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY,MAX_SALARY,JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_IDENT IN (select JOB_ID from employees where YEAR(B_DATE)>1976 );

5.Retrieve JOB information and list of female employees whose birth year is after 1976.
Soln:
select JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY,MAX_SALARY,JOB_IDENT from jobs where JOB_IDENT IN (select JOB_ID from employees where YEAR(B_DATE)>1976 and SEX='F' );

Accessing Multiple Tables with Implicit Joins
Perform an implicit cartesian/cross join between EMPLOYEES and JOBS tables.
Soln:
select * from employees, jobs;
2.Retrieve only the EMPLOYEES records that correspond to jobs in the JOBS table.
Soln:
select * from employees, jobs where employees.JOB_ID = jobs.JOB_IDENT;

3.Redo the previous query, using shorter aliases for table names.
Soln:
select * from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;


4. Redo the previous query, but retrieve only the Employee ID, Employee Name and Job Title.
Soln:
select EMP_ID,F_NAME,L_NAME, JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;

5. Redo the previous query, but specify the fully qualified column names with aliases in the SELECT clause.
Soln:
select E.EMP_ID,E.F_NAME,E.L_NAME, J.JOB_TITLE from employees E, jobs J where E.JOB_ID = J.JOB_IDENT;
